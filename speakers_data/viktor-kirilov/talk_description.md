Ever wanted to modify some value or execute some statement while your C++ program is running just to test something out - not trivial or possible with a debugger? Scripting languages have a REPL (read-eval-print-loop). The closest thing C++ has is cling (developed by researchers at CERN) but it is built on top of LLVM and is very cumbersome to set up.
RCRL (Read-Compile-Run-Loop) is a demo project showcasing an innovative approach to doing runtime C++ compilation in a platform and compiler agnostic way which can be easily embedded. In this presentation we will see how to use it, how it works and how it can be modified and integrated into any application and workflow.
