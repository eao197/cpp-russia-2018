## How to contribute

Clone repository and run debug PHP server locally. On Ubuntu that's easy:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php7.0 php7.0-intl
php -S localhost:8000
```

After that you can open address [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000/) and preview your changes. You can select another port if `:8000` is busy.

If you want to update information related to your talk, look at `speakers_data` directory.
